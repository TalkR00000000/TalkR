Code for the Decentralized Social Media project TalkR

TalkR is a Decentralized Social Media platform. The code revolves around two main projects, the Client, which is what the average User will use to log onto TalkR, and the HUB, which is the Server. HUBs take a little more time and knowledge to run, but they allow you to create your own space on the Network, themed however you like, with the main topics of your choice.
TalkR is based on the old BBS (Bulletin Board System) from before the Internet became popular. Instead of using phone lines and modems, it uses IP addresses. This allows anyone with a little time, some knowledge and the inclination, to create their own Social Media platform that is shared and used by ALL other HUBS on the Network.
By distributing the HUBs, the Network becomes far more robust, and attack resistant. It also allows for a far greater veriety of topics than a single platform would have.
